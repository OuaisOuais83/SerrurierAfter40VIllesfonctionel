The previous AI engineer successfully transformed a basic React application into a premium, SEO-optimized, and high-converting frontend for a locksmith service. Initially, the project addressed core requirements and general improvements for mobile responsiveness, call-to-action visibility, and initial SEO content. A significant evolution occurred with the user's detailed feedback, leading to the creation and dynamic generation of 40 unique, geo-localized city pages, a substantial architectural enhancement to meet local SEO demands. Concurrently, service pages received massive content enrichment and subsequent re-optimization based on explicit user-provided text. The engineer demonstrated an iterative, user-feedback-driven development cycle, consistently using internal tooling for validation and adhering to performance targets like PageSpeed.

<product_requirements>
The overarching goal is to build a premium, high-converting frontend website for Serrure Minute, an emergency locksmith service in Var (83), France. The application must capture generic traffic, prioritize immediate calls, and deliver a sophisticated AHA MOMENT.

Key evolving requirements include:
*   **Pages:** Initially, a Homepage, 5 generic Service Pages, and 5 Local Pages. This expanded significantly to require 40 unique, SEO-optimized Local Pages () for specific cities, each demanding unique meta titles/descriptions, H1s, intro texts (local neighborhoods), specific FAQs, local testimonials, and paragraph variations to prevent duplicate content. Service pages, initially ~200 words, were enriched to over 1500 words, and one specific page (Ouverture de Porte Claquée) was re-optimized with a new detailed content brief (>500 words, specific H1/H2s, FAQ, testimonials, engagements).
*   **Design & UX:** Premium visual language (glass-morphism, shadows, rounded corners, layered design, hover animations), dramatic typography, limited color palette, mobile-first responsiveness, and a sub-1.5s LCP target.
*   **Conversion Optimization:** High-contrast CTAs, ultra-short contact form, clickable sticky phone number, highly visible floating call button (especially on mobile), and a fixed mobile call bar.
*   **SEO:** Optimized Meta Titles/Descriptions per page, H1/H2/H3 structure, Schema LocalBusiness JSON-LD on all pages, og:title, optimized images (<100ko, alt text), , and . Content must be expanded significantly to improve rankings.
*   **Trust:** Integration of professional graphical certification logos (Qualibat, Agréé Assurances, Artisan Certifié, 4.9/5 star rating).
